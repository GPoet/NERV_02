## Quick start

1. **Click "Use this template"** on GitHub to create your own copy
2. **Enable GitHub Actions** — go to the **Actions** tab in your fork and click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
3. **Add secrets** — go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add:

| Secret | | Used by |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | **Required** | All skills (see auth setup below) |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | **Recommended** | Notifications + bidirectional messaging ([setup](#telegram-integration)) |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | **Recommended** | Notifications + bidirectional messaging |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Optional | Bidirectional messaging on Discord (read messages) |
| `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | Optional | Which Discord channel to monitor |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional | Notifications (outbound) |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Optional | Bidirectional messaging on Slack (read messages) |
| `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | Optional | Which Slack channel to monitor |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Optional | Notifications (outbound) |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | Optional | `digest`, `tweet-digest`, `fetch-tweets` — X/Twitter search via Grok |
| `COINGECKO_API_KEY` | Optional | `token-alert` — works without, key improves rate limits |
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | Optional | `on-chain-monitor`, `wallet-digest`, `defi-monitor` — use in RPC URLs |

4. **Edit `aeon.yml`** — set `enabled: true` on the skills you want
5. **Test** — go to **Actions > Run Skill > Run workflow** and enter a skill name (e.g. `article`)

### Getting your auth token

**Option A: Claude Code OAuth token (recommended)** — uses your existing Claude Pro/Max subscription, no separate API billing.

1. Install [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and run:
   ```bash
   claude setup-token
   ```
2. It opens a browser for OAuth login, then prints a long-lived token (`sk-ant-oat01-...`, valid for 1 year).
3. Add it as the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret in your repo.

**Option B: Standard API key** — usage-based billing through console.anthropic.com.

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and create a key.
2. Add it as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` in your repo secrets (it works in the same field).

## How it works

Two GitHub Actions workflows work together. A scheduler (`messages.yml`) runs every 5 minutes — it checks for incoming messages (Telegram, Discord, Slack) and matches skills from `aeon.yml` by their cron schedule. When a skill matches, it dispatches it to the runner (`aeon.yml`), which tells Claude Code to read and execute that skill's markdown file. After Claude finishes, the workflow commits all changes back to your repo.

The **heartbeat** is the core loop. The scheduler checks every 5 minutes, but heartbeat itself runs hourly as the fallback — whenever no other skill is scheduled for that hour, heartbeat takes over and scans for anything that needs attention: stalled PRs, flagged memory items, missed skill runs, urgent issues. If nothing needs attention, it exits silently. If something does, it notifies you and logs the finding.

```
Every 5 min, messages.yml fires
  → Poll job: checks Telegram/Discord/Slack for new messages
    → Message found → runs Claude to interpret and respond
    → No message   → exits (~10 seconds)
  → Schedule job: checks aeon.yml for skills due now
    → Match found → dispatches to aeon.yml (skill runner)
    → No match    → exits (~10 seconds)
```

Monitor-type skills that find nothing log an ack (`HEARTBEAT_OK`, `TOKEN_ALERT_OK`, etc.) and the workflow skips the commit — zero noise when nothing needs attention.

## Configuration

All scheduling is done in `aeon.yml`. Skills default to `enabled: false` — turn on what you need:

```yaml
skills:
  article:
    enabled: true               # ← flip this to activate
    schedule: "0 8 * * *"       # Daily at 8am UTC
  digest:
    enabled: false              # ← off by default
    schedule: "0 14 * * *"
```

The schedule format is standard cron (`minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`). All times are UTC. The parser supports `*`, `*/N`, exact values, and comma-separated lists (`1,15` for 1st and 15th of the month).

**Order matters** — the scheduler picks the first matching skill. Day-specific skills (e.g. Monday-only) are listed before daily skills so they get priority on their day. Heartbeat is always last as the fallback.

### Changing the check frequency

The workflow cron (`*/5 * * * *`) controls how often the scheduler checks. You can change this in `.github/workflows/messages.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '*/5 * * * *'   # Check every 5 min (default)
  - cron: '*/15 * * * *'  # Check every 15 min (saves Actions minutes)
  - cron: '0 * * * *'     # Check hourly (most conservative)
```

The check itself is cheap (~10 seconds of bash) — it only installs Claude Code and calls the API when a skill actually matches.

### GitHub Actions billing

GitHub Actions bills by **minutes used per month**. Only the time a runner is active counts.

| Plan | Free minutes/month | Cost after |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Free | 2,000 | Not available on free plan for private repos |
| Pro | 3,000 | $0.008/min |
| Team | 3,000 | $0.008/min |

**What costs what:**
- **No skill matched** (most 5-min ticks): ~10 seconds. Checkout + bash parse + exit. At `*/5`, that's ~288 checks/day = ~48 minutes/day.
- **Skill runs**: 2-10 minutes each depending on complexity (Claude thinking + web search + file writes).
- **Heartbeat (hourly)**: ~2 minutes if nothing found, more if it investigates something.

**To reduce usage:**
- Change the cron to `*/15` or `0 *` (hourly) — fewer empty checks
- Disable skills you don't need (`enabled: false`)
- Keep the repo **public** — public repos get unlimited free Actions minutes

## Notifications

Aeon fans out notifications to every configured channel. Set the secret and it activates — no code changes needed.

| Channel | Secret(s) |
|---------|-----------|
| Telegram | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` |
| Discord | `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` |
| Slack | `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` |

**Discord setup:** Channel settings → Integrations → Webhooks → Create Webhook → copy URL.

**Slack setup:** api.slack.com → Create App → Incoming Webhooks → activate → pick channel → copy URL.

## Config files

Config files are created on demand — each skill documents the format it expects in a `## Config` section in its `SKILL.md`. Common ones:

| File | Created by | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| `memory/feeds.yml` | `rss-digest` | RSS/Atom feed URLs |
| `memory/subreddits.yml` | `reddit-digest` | Subreddits to monitor |
| `memory/watched-repos.md` | `github-monitor`, `pr-review`, etc. | GitHub repos to monitor |
| `memory/on-chain-watches.yml` | `on-chain-monitor`, `wallet-digest`, `defi-monitor` | Blockchain addresses/contracts |

None of these files ship with the template — create them when you enable the relevant skill.

## Telegram integration

Send messages to your Telegram bot and Aeon will interpret them — run skills, answer questions, or update memory. Polls every 5 minutes.

**Setup:**
1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` to your repo secrets
3. Send your bot a message like "write an article about quantum computing"

Only messages from your `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are accepted — anyone else is ignored.

By default, Aeon polls Telegram every 5 minutes. This means up to a 5-minute delay before your message is picked up. If that's fine, you're done — no extra setup needed.

### Instant mode (optional)

To get near-instant responses, you can deploy a tiny webhook that triggers Aeon immediately when you send a message. This replaces the 5-minute polling delay with a ~1 second trigger. You still need the polling workflow as a fallback.

The webhook receives messages from Telegram and calls GitHub's `repository_dispatch` API to trigger the workflow instantly. It's ~20 lines of code.

**Option A: Cloudflare Worker (free tier: 100k requests/day)**

1. Create a worker at [workers.cloudflare.com](https://workers.cloudflare.com) with this code:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const { message } = await request.json();
    if (!message?.text || String(message.chat.id) !== env.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID) {
      return new Response("ignored");
    }

    // Confirm receipt so polling doesn't reprocess
    await fetch(
      `https://api.telegram.org/bot${env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}/getUpdates?offset=${message.update_id + 1}`
    );

    // Trigger GitHub Actions
    await fetch(
      `https://api.github.com/repos/${env.GITHUB_REPO}/dispatches`,
      {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          Authorization: `token ${env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
          Accept: "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          event_type: "telegram-message",
          client_payload: { message: message.text },
        }),
      }
    );

    return new Response("ok");
  },
};
```

2. Add these environment variables in the Cloudflare dashboard:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Your bot token |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Your chat ID |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | `your-name/aeon` |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | A [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with `repo` scope |

3. Set your Telegram bot webhook to point to the worker:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=https://your-worker.workers.dev"
```

**Option B: Railway / Vercel / any serverless platform**

Same code, different host. Deploy the webhook handler above as a serverless function on whichever platform you prefer. The logic is identical — receive Telegram webhook, call GitHub `repository_dispatch`.

## Trigger feature builds from issues

Add the label `ai-build` to any GitHub issue. The workflow fires automatically and Claude will read the issue, implement it, and open a PR.

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `skills/your-skill/SKILL.md` with instructions for Claude:

```markdown
---
name: My Skill
description: What this skill does
---

Your task is to...
```

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) format — compatible with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and 37+ agents.

2. Add it to `aeon.yml` with a schedule and enable it:

```yaml
skills:
  your-skill:
    enabled: true
    schedule: "0 12 * * *"   # Daily at noon UTC
```

That's it — no workflow changes needed. On-demand skills don't need a schedule entry — trigger them via Telegram or `workflow_dispatch`.

## Running locally

```bash
# Run any skill locally (requires Claude Code CLI)
claude -p "Today is $(date +%Y-%m-%d). Read and execute the skill defined in skills/article/SKILL.md" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Two-repo strategy

This repo is a **public template**. For your own instance, we recommend creating a private copy so your memory, articles, and API keys stay private.

### Setup

1. **Click "Use this template"** → **Create a new repository** → make it **private** (e.g. `your-name/aeon`).
2. Add your secrets to the **private** fork (not the public template).
3. Customize `CLAUDE.md`, `aeon.yml`, `memory/MEMORY.md`, and skill prompts in your private fork.
4. All generated content (articles, digests, memory) stays in your private fork.

### Pulling updates from the template

When the public template gets new skills or workflow improvements:

```bash
# In your private fork
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aaronjmars/aeon.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main --no-edit
```

This merges template changes without overwriting your personal content, since your articles/memory are in files that don't exist in the template.
